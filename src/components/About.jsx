                    I enjoy designing websites, applications and everything that is front-end. Minimalism also inspires me.
                    A nice cup of tea always helps me keep in focus üçµ

                    During my studies I have encountered hardships especially in 2021 and 2022. Thanks to my problem solving skills,
                    I have quickly carried through myself those situations and managed to accomplish greater things.

                    In my free time, I love working on my hobby porjects that usually involves front-end development but, I am not afraid of making 
                    full-stack projects as I am willing to be challenged. Additionally, I revel in the art of Photography.
